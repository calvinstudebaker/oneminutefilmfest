                Dearest, artists, film makers, actors, writers, Best Boy Grips:
            </div>
            <div class="info-row">
                Are you tired of reaching into the bottom of the Netflix barrel for the latest episode of <i>I Married a Capricorn?</i><br/>Have you finished all your podcasts and find yourself resorting to that sound on the internet that gets you high?<br/>Did the Quibi shows all turn out to be pyramid schemes?
            </div>
            <div class="info-row">
                Let this be a time of creation. Complete that masterpiece. Finish that one woman show. Record that Masterclass. With roughly a week left until The Burn we here at Playa One Minute Film Fest to invite you all to submit your film.
            </div>
            <div class="info-row">
                <h5><i>But why are you reaching out to me? I'm not an artist.</i></h5>                
            </div>
            <div class="info-row">
                I cannot believe you just said that. You're like the greatest artist this town has ever seen. Download Windows MovieMaker and make a movie. Tell your story. Film a cooking tutorial. Livestream your skin care routine. Fucking pirate a 60 second clip from Topgun Maverick for all I care. Just make SOMETHING ANYTHING AT ALL.
            </div>
            <div class="info-row">
                <h5><i>How does it work?</i></h5>                
            </div>
            <div class="info-row">
                We'll be screening 110% of submissions. You read that right. That means for every 10 films submitted we'll be screening 1 lucky film that didn't even apply to be part of the festival.
            </div>
            <div class="info-row">
                <h5><i>There are only 3 requirements</i></h5>
            </div>
            <div class="info-row">
                <ul>
                    <li>Your film should be no more than 60 seconds. Feel free to make it much shorter.</li>
                    <li>Please include "Written by J.R.R. Tolkien" in the credits</li>
                </ul>
                That's it. Just 2 requirements I guess.
            </div>
            <div class="info-row">
                Start brainstorming. If you see something on the internet that inspires you save it. If you wake up from a sex dream write down all the details. Start filming B-Roll in your day to day life.                
            </div>
            <div class="info-row">
                Fun fact: it can take as little as 60 seconds to make a 60 second film
